            <p style={{fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Basics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan specifically designed to help families save for future college expenses. These plans are sponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions and offer a range of investment options.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>Tax Advantages: Contributions to a 529 plan grow tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on investment earnings as long as the funds remain in the account. Additionally, qualified withdrawals used for eligible education expenses are tax-free at the federal level and often at the state level, providing valuable tax benefits.
                </li>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>State Tax Benefits: Many states offer additional tax benefits for contributions to their state-sponsored 529 plans, such as tax deductions or credits for contributions. These state tax benefits can provide further incentives for saving for education expenses.
                </li>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>Use for Qualified Expenses: Funds from a 529 plan can be used to pay for a wide range of qualified education expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, supplies, and even certain technology expenses. This flexibility makes 529 plans suitable for saving for various educational goals, from K-12 to college and beyond.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Cons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>Penalties for Non-Qualified Withdrawals: Withdrawals from a 529 plan that are not used for qualified education expenses may be subject to income taxes and a 10% penalty on earnings. This penalty can erode the value of the account if funds are withdrawn for non-education purposes.
                </li>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>Impact on Financial Aid Eligibility: Funds in a 529 plan are considered an asset of the account owner, which can affect financial aid eligibility for the beneficiary. While assets in a parent-owned 529 plan are generally treated more favorably than other assets in the financial aid formula, they can still impact eligibility for need-based aid.
                </li>
                <li style={{fontSize: '1.5rem'}}>Plan Fees and Expenses: 529 plans may charge fees and expenses, including administrative fees, investment management fees, and other costs. These fees can vary by plan and may impact the overall return on investment over time.
                </li>
